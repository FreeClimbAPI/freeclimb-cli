For convenience, a Logs list resource is also available as a subresource of a Call instance resource, since most logging occurs during call processing.

The Calls list resource represents the set of all phone Calls made to and from an account. FreeClimb currently does not support direct SIP user agent endpoints.

      "applications": {
        "description": " An Application in FreeClimb is just a set of configuration data and URLs that FreeClimb invokes to notify the app of an event or to retrieve instructions on how to behave in response to an event, such as when one of the phone numbers associated with the Application receives a Call. Applications are useful for encapsulating configuration information that we need to distribute across multiple phone numbers. Any number of phone numbers can point to a single Application so that they share a common set of properties and URLs. This makes it possible to change the configuration of a large number of phone numbers by modifying a single Application instance. If we create an Application with its voiceUrl set to http://www.example.com/answer, we can assign that Application to all of our incoming phone numbers and FreeClimb will make a request to that URL whenever an inbound call arrives. Likewise, when making outbound calls using the REST API, we can specify an applicationId to handle the outbound request and FreeClimb will make a request to the callConnectUrl of the Application. The callConnectUrl property is used instead of the voiceUrl property for outbound calls. The behavior of the callConnectUrl and voiceUrl are different because of the difference in ‘behavior’ when making an outbound call and answering an inbound call; the main difference being that an outbound call may not actually be connected (e.g. busy, no answer). For incoming SMS messages, we can specify an smsUrl which FreeClimb will request when a number assigned to our Application receives an SMS message. An Application resource is represented by the following properties:"
      },
      "accounts": {
        "description": " You get a FreeClimb Account at signup. This includes an account ID (accountId) and an authentication token (authToken). These two properties enable you to connect and communicate with FreeClimb. An Account resource is represented by the following properties:"
