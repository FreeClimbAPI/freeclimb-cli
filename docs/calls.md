`freeclimb calls`
=================

A Call represents a voice connection between FreeClimb and a remote end point. This connection may be inbound or outbound (when an application initiates the Call, either via the REST API or the OutDial PerCL command. The Calls list resource represents the set of all phone Calls made to and from an account.

## `freeclimb calls:make FROM TO APPLICATIONID`

Making a Call may take time. A 202 status code is returned if the Call request was successfully queued by FreeClimb, otherwise, a 500 error is returned. The asynchronous callback for the result will occur after some time through the callConnectUrl.

```
USAGE
  $ freeclimb calls:make FROM TO APPLICATIONID

ARGUMENTS
  FROM
      Phone number to use as the caller ID. This can be: (a) The To or From number provided in FreeClimb's initial request
      to your app or (b) Any incoming phone number you have purchased from FreeClimb.

  TO
      Phone number to place the Call to. For trial accounts, this must be a Verified Number.

  APPLICATIONID
      ID of the application FreeClimb should use to handle this phone call. FreeClimb will use the callConnectUrl and
      statusCallbackUrl set on the application unless the callConnectUrl attribute is also provided with the request. In
      this case, the URL specified in that callConnectUrl attribute will be used as a replacement of the callConnectUrl
      originally assigned in the application. The application must have a callConnectUrl associated with it or an error
      will be returned. The applicationâ€™s voiceUrl parameter is not used for outbound calls.

OPTIONS
  -I, --ifMachineUrl=ifMachineUrl
      This attribute specifies a URL to which FreeClimb will make a POST request when an answering machine or a fax
      machine is detected. This URL is required if the ifMachine flag is set to redirect. When ifMachine is set to hangup,
      ifMachineUrl must not be included in the request.

  -P, --parentCallId=parentCallId
      Required if no applicationId or callConnecturl have been provided. The ID of the parent Call in the case that this
      new Call is meant to be treated as a child of an existing Call. This attribute should be included when possible to
      reduce latency when adding child calls to Conferences containing the parent Call. A call can only be used as a
      parent once the call is in progress or as an inbound call that is still ringing. An outbound call is considered to
      be in progress once the outdialConnect or outdialApiConnect webhook is invoked. An inbound call is ringing when the
      inbound webhook is invoked. If a callConnectUrl attribute is also included with the parentCallId in the request,
      this URL will be used as a replacement of the callConnectUrl originally assigned in the parent call.

  -c, --callConnectUrl=callConnectUrl
      The URL that FreeClimb should use to handle this phone call. If an applicationId or parentCallId have already been
      provided, this callConnectUrl attribute will be used as a replacement of the callConnectUrl originally assigned in
      the application or parent call.

  -h, --help
      show CLI help

  -i, --ifMachine=ifMachine
      Specifies how FreeClimb should handle this Call if an answering machine answers it.

  -p, --privacyMode=true|false
      Indicates if the request contains sensitive information which should be hidden. When set to true, the contents of
      the sendDigits field will be replaced with the string XXXXX in the logs.

  -s, --sendDigits=sendDigits
      String of digits to dial after connecting to the number. It can include digits 0-9, *, and #, and allows embedding a
      pause between the output of individual digits. The default pause is 500 milliseconds. So, a string such as 1234#
      will be played in 2 seconds because of the 4 standard pauses implied within the string. A custom pause is specified
      by including a positive integer wrapped in curly braces: {n}.

  -t, --timeout=timeout
      Number of seconds that FreeClimb should allow the phone to ring before assuming there is no answer. Default is 30
      seconds. Maximum allowed ring-time is determined by the target phone's provider. Note that most providers limit
      ring-time to 120 seconds.
```

## `freeclimb calls:update CALLID STATUS`

Call hang up may take time. A 202 status code is returned if the hangup request was successfully queued by FreeClimb. Otherwise, an error code is returned. If successfully queued, the asynchronous callback for the result will occur after some time through the statusCallbackUrl.

```
USAGE
  $ freeclimb calls:update CALLID STATUS

ARGUMENTS
  CALLID  String that uniquely identifies this call resource.

  STATUS  Either canceled or completed. Specifying canceled attempts to hang up calls that are queued without affecting
          calls already in progress. Specifying completed attempts to hang up a call already in progress.

OPTIONS
  -h, --help  show CLI help
```
