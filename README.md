## Examples
Review [Other Use Cases](https://docs.freeclimb.com/docs/freeclimb-cli-quickstart#other-use-cases)

## Troubleshooting
Newer versions of Node may give an invalid header value error when using the CLI. To resolve this issue: 
 1. Use Node version 14.15.0
 2. Add NODE_OPTIONS as a persistent environment variable by running the following command:
 ```
 $ echo export NODE_OPTIONS=--http-parser=legacy >> ~/.bash_profile
 $ source ~/.bash_profile
 ```
Possible resolutions for "TypeError: cannot read property of undefined":
 1. Make sure to add NODE_OPTIONS as a persistent environment variable as explained in the section above
 2. CLI does not have correct write permissions to the OCLIF configuration directory (information about the data directory is [here](https://oclif.io/docs/config))
